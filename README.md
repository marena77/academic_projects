This repository contains my most pertinent and influential projects that I completed for courses at UMD. Below I have a list of projects and descriptions.

- Distance Vector demonstrates distance vector routing using a virtual network, where Unix processes are network nodes, which communicate over UDP. This was implemented using C in a Docker environment

- Chat Server is a TCP server written in C which was reverse engineered by listening to network traffic between the "client" binary file and a server which was hosted by the CS department at UMD. It has multiple chat "rooms", private messaging, etc. Essentially an IRC clone.

- GTSAM is an implementation of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using Georgia Tech's Smoothing and Mapping, written in MATLAB. Given the video frames seen in the Data folder, I was tasked with reconstructing the flight path of the drone which took that video as a series of 3d points. The file "3d.jpg" shows that resultant path.

- MicroCaml is an interpreter, lexer, and parser for a functional programming language, written in OCaml, which it is essentially a clone of.

- Collaborative Art is an Android app written in Kotlin which is a social media app designed and created by a peer and friend of mine. Similar to Instagram, users can make posts with captions, find other users and posts using location data, and register other users as friends. All data is contained on Google's Firebase Realtime Database, which the app constantly reads and writes from.
