In general, nodes do the following:

Set up async IO, so that when a data packet comes in, we use a signal handler function
to update routing table with that information
We set this up on all directly connected link sockets, any of which could trigger the 
handler function

Set up a signal alarm which sends an ad packet automatically every update_time seconds

general walk_el function fixes routing table based on topology changes, constructs and ad 
packet and sends to all directly connected neighbors
